## Content

This project has some HTML and CSS styling to display an interactive Landing Page.  The logic for the dynamic content is built in JavaScript.

## Implementation

Active sections in view are highlighted when scrolling. A floating button to smooth scroll to the top of the page becomes visible when below the Landing Page. The navigation bar is hidden when scrolling and reappears when the user stops scrolling. Scrolling is enabled to each section with offset compensation for the navigation bar.
